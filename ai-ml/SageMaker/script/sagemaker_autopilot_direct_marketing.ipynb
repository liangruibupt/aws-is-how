    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Autopilot is an automated machine learning (commonly referred to as AutoML) solution for tabular datasets. You can use SageMaker Autopilot in different ways: on autopilot (hence the name) or with human guidance, without code through SageMaker Studio, or using the AWS SDKs. This notebook, as a first glimpse, will use the AWS SDKs to simply create and deploy a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical introductory task in machine learning (the \"Hello World\" equivalent) is one that uses a dataset to predict whether a customer will enroll for a term deposit at a bank, after one or more phone calls. For more information about the task and the dataset used, see [Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct marketing, through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers.  Because resources and a customer's attention are limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer.  Predicting those potential customers based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem. You can imagine that this task would readily translate to marketing lead prioritization in your own organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how you can use Autopilot on this dataset to get the most accurate ML pipeline through exploring a number of potential options, or \"candidates\". Each candidate generated by Autopilot consists of two steps. The first step performs automated feature engineering on the dataset and the second step trains and tunes an algorithm to produce a model. When you deploy this model, it follows similar steps. Feature engineering followed by inference, to decide whether the lead is worth pursuing or not. The notebook contains instructions on how to train the model as well as to deploy the model to perform batch predictions on a set of leads. Where it is possible, use the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK, a high level SDK, to simplify the way you interact with Amazon SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples demonstrate how to customize models in various ways. For instance, models deployed to devices typically have memory constraints that need to be satisfied as well as accuracy. Other use cases have real-time deployment requirements and latency constraints. For now, keep it simple."

    "Before you run Autopilot on the dataset, first perform a check of the dataset to make sure that it has no obvious errors. The Autopilot process can take long time, and it's generally a good practice to inspect the dataset before you start a job. This particular dataset is small, so you can inspect it in the notebook instance itself. If you have a larger dataset that will not fit in a notebook instance memory, inspect the dataset offline using a big data analytics tool like Apache Spark. [Deequ](https://github.com/awslabs/deequ) is a library built on top of Apache Spark that can be helpful for performing checks on large datasets. Autopilot is capable of handling datasets up to 5 GB.\n"
