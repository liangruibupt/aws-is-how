    "In this demo, we are using [Caltech-256](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech256/) dataset, which contains 30608 images of 256 objects. For the training and validation data, we follow the splitting scheme in this MXNet [example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/image-classification/data/caltech256.sh). In particular, it randomly selects 60 images per class for training, and uses the remaining data for validation. The algorithm takes `RecordIO` file as input. The user can also provide the image files as input, which will be converted into `RecordIO` format using MXNet's [im2rec](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/how_to/recordio.html?highlight=im2rec) tool. It takes around 50 seconds to convert the entire Caltech-256 dataset (~1.2GB) on a p2.xlarge instance. However, for this demo, we will use record io format. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the data available in the correct format for training, the next step is to actually train the model using the data. After setting training parameters, we kick off training, and poll for status until training is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training parameters\n",
    "There are two kinds of parameters that need to be set for training. The first one are the parameters for the training job. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input specification**: These are the training and validation channels that specify the path where training data is present. These are specified in the \"InputDataConfig\" section. The main parameters that need to be set is the \"ContentType\" which can be set to \"rec\" or \"lst\" based on the input data format and the S3Uri which specifies the bucket and the folder where the data is present. \n",
    "* **Output specification**: This is specified in the \"OutputDataConfig\" section. We just need to specify the path where the output can be stored after training\n",
    "* **Resource config**: This section specifies the type of instance on which to run the training and the number of hosts used for training. If \"InstanceCount\" is more than 1, then training can be run in a distributed manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the above set of parameters, there are hyperparameters that are specific to the algorithm. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **num_layers**: The number of layers (depth) for the network. We use 18 in this samples but other values such as 34, 50, ,101, 152 can be used. \n",
    "* **num_training_samples**: This is the total number of training samples. It is set to 15420 for caltech dataset with the current split\n",
    "* **num_classes**: This is the number of output classes for the new dataset. Imagenet was trained with 1000 output classes but the number of output classes can be changed for fine-tuning. For caltech, we use 257 because it has 256 object categories + 1 clutter class\n",
    "* **epochs**: Number of training epochs\n",
    "* **learning_rate**: Learning rate for training\n",
    "* **mini_batch_size**: The number of training samples used for each mini batch. In distributed training, the number of training samples used per batch will be N * mini_batch_size where N is the number of hosts on which training is run"
