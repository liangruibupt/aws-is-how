      "\n",
      "Let me double-check this. Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$? Yes, this follows directly from Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions because 3 and 4 are coprime.\n",

Consider the number $N = 4 \\cdot p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_k - 1$. This number is congruent to -1 modulo 4, which means it's congruent to 3 modulo 4.\n",

But $N$ is not divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ because dividing $N$ by any of these primes leaves a remainder of -1. So $N$ must be divisible by some prime $q$ that's not on our list. And since $N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, and all primes except 2 are odd, $q$ must also be congruent to 3 modulo 4 (otherwise, if $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $N/q$ would also have to be congruent to 3 modulo 4, and we could repeat the argument with $N/q$, eventually reaching a prime congruent to 3 modulo 4 that's not on our list).\n",

      "Let's try a different approach. We know from elementary number theory that if we have a product of numbers each congruent to 1 modulo 4, then the product is also congruent to 1 modulo 4.

      "\n",
      "4) Either N is prime, or N has a prime factor q\n",
      "\n",
      "5) This prime factor q cannot be any of our original primes p₁ through pₙ (since dividing N by any of these leaves remainder -1)\n",
