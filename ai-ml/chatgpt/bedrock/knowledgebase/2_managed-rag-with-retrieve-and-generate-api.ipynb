    "# Module 2 - Build RAG-powered Q&A Application with **RetrieveAndGenerate API**\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides sample code and step-by-step instructions for building a fully-managed question-answering (Q&A) application using a **RetrieveAndGenerate API** of Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we demonstrated how to create a Knowledge Base in Amazon Bedrock — including setting up an S3 data source, configuring an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless (AOSS) vector index, and ingesting documents for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we take the next step: building a Q&A application that can query that Knowledge Base using the `RetrieveAndGenerate` API. This API allows you to retrieve the most relevant content from your Knowledge Base based on a user’s query and automatically pass that information to a foundation model (FM) to generate a grounded, context-aware response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic example of the RAG pattern — where external data is dynamically retrieved at query time and incorporated into the model’s prompt to improve relevance, accuracy, and transparency. In this solution, retrieved knowledge base content comes with source attribution, helping end users understand the origin of the response and minimizing the risk of model hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Fully-managed RAG with **RetreiveAndGenerate API**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RetrieveAndGenerate` API provides a fully managed way to implement the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user submits a query, the API automatically converts the query into vector embeddings, performs a similarity search against the Knowledge Base, and retrieves the most relevant document chunks. These search results are then injected into the foundation model's prompt as additional context, enabling the model to generate more accurate and grounded responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-turn conversations, Knowledge Bases also maintain short-term conversational memory — allowing the API to return more contextually relevant answers across a dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the `RetrieveAndGenerate` API includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **generated response** from the foundation model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source attribution** metadata for the retrieved content\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **actual retrieved text chunks** from the Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it easy to build RAG-powered applications with trusted, explainable answers — without having to manage retrieval pipelines or prompt construction yourself.\n",

It's not normal for a company of any size to be able to respond to something as discontinuous and unpredictable as this pandemic turned out to be. What is it about Amazon that made it possible for us to do so? It's because we weren't starting from a standing start. We had been iterating on and remaking our fulfillment capabilities for nearly two decades. In every business we pursue, we're constantly experimenting and inventing. We're divinely discontented with customer experiences, whether they're our own or not. We believe these customer experiences can always be better, and we strive to make customers' lives better and easier every day. The beauty of this mission is that you never run out of runway; customers always want better, and our job is both to listen to their feedback and to imagine what else is possible and invent on their behalf. People often assume that the game-changing inventions they admire just pop out of somebody's head, a light bulb goes off, a team executes to that idea, and presto-you have a new invention that's a breakaway success for a long time. That's rarely, if ever, how it happens. One of the lesser known facts about innovative companies like Amazon is that they are relentlessly debating, re-defining, tinkering, iterating, and experimenting to take the seed of a big idea and make it into something that resonates with customers and meaningfully changes their customer experience over a long period of time. Let me give you some Amazon examples. **Our Fulfillment Network:** Going back to the pandemic, there's no way we could have started working on our fulfillment network in March 2020 and satisfied anything close to what our customers needed. We'd been innovating in our fulfillment network for 20 years, constantly trying to shorten the time to get items to customers. In the early 2000s, it took us an average of 18 hours to get an item through our fulfillment centers and on the right truck for shipment. Now, it takes us two. To deliver as reliably and cost-effectively as we desire, and to serve Amazon Prime members expecting shipments in a couple of days, we spent years building out an expansive set of fulfillment centers, a substantial logistics and transportation capability, and reconfigured how we did virtually everything in our facilities.\",\n",

However, unlike physical retailers, Amazon can tailor these sponsored products to be relevant to what customers are searching for given what we know about shopping behaviors and our very deep investment in machine learning algorithms. This leads to advertising that's more useful for customers; and as a result, performs better for brands. This is part of why our Advertising revenue has continued to grow rapidly (23% YoY in Q4 2022, 25% YoY overall for 2022 on a $31B revenue base), even as most large advertising-focused businesses' growth have slowed over the last several quarters. We strive to be the best place for advertisers to build their brands. We have near and long-term opportunities that will help us achieve that mission. We're continuing to make large investments in machine learning to keep honing our advertising selection algorithms. For the past couple of years, we've invested in building comprehensive, flexible, and durable planning and measurement solutions, giving marketers greater insight into advertising effectiveness. An example is Amazon Marketing Cloud (\\\"AMC\\\"). AMC is a \\\"clean room\\\" (i.e. secure digital environment) in which advertisers can run custom audience and campaign analytics across a range of first and third-party inputs, in a privacy-safe manner, to generate advertising and business insights to inform their broader marketing and sales strategies. The Advertising and AWS teams have collaborated to enable companies to store their data in AWS, operate securely in AMC with Amazon and other third-party data sources, perform analytics in AWS, and have the option to activate advertising on Amazon or third-party publishers through the Amazon Demand-Side Platform. Customers really like this concerted capability. We also see future opportunity to thoughtfully integrate advertising into our video, live sports, audio, and grocery products. We'll continue to work hard to help brands uniquely engage with the right audience, and grow this part of our business. While it's tempting in turbulent times only to focus on your existing large businesses, to build a sustainable, long-lasting, growing company that helps customers across a large number of dimensions, you can't stop inventing and working on long-term customer experiences that can meaningfully impact customers and your company. When we look at new investment opportunities, we ask ourselves a few questions: - If we were successful, could it be big and have a reasonable return on invested capital? - Is the opportunity being well-served today? - Do we have a differentiated approach? - And, do we have competence in that area?\",\n",

However, unlike physical retailers, Amazon can tailor these sponsored products to be relevant to what customers are searching for given what we know about shopping behaviors and our very deep investment in machine learning algorithms. This leads to advertising that's more useful for customers; and as a result, performs better for brands. This is part of why our Advertising revenue has continued to grow rapidly (23% YoY in Q4 2022, 25% YoY overall for 2022 on a $31B revenue base), even as most large advertising-focused businesses' growth have slowed over the last several quarters. We strive to be the best place for advertisers to build their brands. We have near and long-term opportunities that will help us achieve that mission. We're continuing to make large investments in machine learning to keep honing our advertising selection algorithms. For the past couple of years, we've invested in building comprehensive, flexible, and durable planning and measurement solutions, giving marketers greater insight into advertising effectiveness. An example is Amazon Marketing Cloud (\\\"AMC\\\"). AMC is a \\\"clean room\\\" (i.e. secure digital environment) in which advertisers can run custom audience and campaign analytics across a range of first and third-party inputs, in a privacy-safe manner, to generate advertising and business insights to inform their broader marketing and sales strategies. The Advertising and AWS teams have collaborated to enable companies to store their data in AWS, operate securely in AMC with Amazon and other third-party data sources, perform analytics in AWS, and have the option to activate advertising on Amazon or third-party publishers through the Amazon Demand-Side Platform. Customers really like this concerted capability. We also see future opportunity to thoughtfully integrate advertising into our video, live sports, audio, and grocery products. We'll continue to work hard to help brands uniquely engage with the right audience, and grow this part of our business. While it's tempting in turbulent times only to focus on your existing large businesses, to build a sustainable, long-lasting, growing company that helps customers across a large number of dimensions, you can't stop inventing and working on long-term customer experiences that can meaningfully impact customers and your company. When we look at new investment opportunities, we ask ourselves a few questions: - If we were successful, could it be big and have a reasonable return on invested capital? - Is the opportunity being well-served today? - Do we have a differentiated approach? - And, do we have competence in that area?\",\n",

But, we still have a ways to go, and we'll approach it like we do other customer experiences-we'll keep learning, inventing, and iterating until we have more transformational results. We won't be satisfied until we do. Similarly, at our scale, we have a significant carbon footprint. It's a big part of why we created The Climate Pledge a few years ago (a pledge to be net-zero carbon by 2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Agreement). We're making significant progress on this effort (we're committed to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025-five years ahead of our original target of 2030, we have ordered over 100,000 electric vans to deliver packages, and have over 300 companies who've joined us in The Climate Pledge). But, we have a different challenge than most companies given the diversity and intensity of our operations (including shipping billions of packages per year). We're committed to the challenge, but it will take relentless invention. We also are trying to increase the amount of affordable housing in the communities in which we have a large presence. Our more than $2 billion Housing Equity Fund that we started a year ago has already allocated $1.2 billion toward affordable housing initiatives in the areas around Washington state's Puget Sound region, Arlington (Virginia), and Nashville (Tennessee). A final quick example is Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite network that we're spending over $10 billion to build in the next several years. Kuiper will serve customers with minimal to no fixed broadband connectivity, changing access to information and resources for many communities (analysts estimate approximately 300- 400 million customers globally are in this category). We're optimistic that there is a pretty good business model for us too, but we'll see-and it's a real game changer for underserved families and businesses that will unfold over many years as we keep evolving its capabilities. This type of iterative innovation is pervasive across every team at Amazon. I could have given comparable examples in Advertising, Grocery, Gaming, Amazon Music, Amazon Care (our telemedicine offering), or Pharmacy, to name a few. All of these stories are still being written as we rapidly experiment, learn, and continue to try to make our customer experience better every day.\",\n",

Amazon provides every full-time employee with health insurance, a 401(k) plan, 20 weeks paid maternity leave, and other benefits. These are the same benefits that Amazon's most senior executives receive. And with our rapidly changing economy, we see more clearly than ever the need for workers to evolve their skills continually to keep up with technology. That's why we're spending $700 million to provide more than 100,000 Amazonians access to training programs, at their places of work, in high-demand fields such as healthcare, cloud computing, and machine learning. Since 2012, we have offered Career Choice, a pre-paid tuition program for fulfillment center associates looking to move into high- demand occupations. Amazon pays up to 95% of tuition and fees toward a certificate or diploma in qualified fields of study, leading to enhanced employment opportunities in high-demand jobs. Since its launch, more than 25,000 Amazonians have received training for in-demand occupations. To ensure that future generations have the skills they need to thrive in a technology-driven economy, we started a program last year called Amazon Future Engineer, which is designed to educate and train low-income and disadvantaged young people to pursue careers in computer science. We have an ambitious goal: to help hundreds of thousands of students each year learn computer science and coding. Amazon Future Engineer currently funds Introduction to Computer Science and AP Computer Science classes for more than 2,000 schools in underserved communities across the country. Each year, Amazon Future Engineer also gives 100 four-year, $40,000 college scholarships to computer science students from low-income backgrounds. Those scholarship recipients also receive guaranteed, paid internships at Amazon after their first year of college. Our program in the UK funds 120 engineering apprenticeships and helps students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursue technology careers. For now, my own time and thinking continues to be focused on COVID-19 and how Amazon can help while we're in the middle of it. I am extremely grateful to my fellow Amazonians for all the grit and ingenuity they are showing as we move through this. You can count on all of us to look beyond the immediate crisis for insights and lessons and how to apply them going forward. Reflect on this from Theodor Seuss Geisel: *\\\"When something bad happens you have three choices. You can either let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you.\\\"* I am very optimistic about which of these civilization is going to choose.\",\n",

It's not normal for a company of any size to be able to respond to something as discontinuous and unpredictable as this pandemic turned out to be. What is it about Amazon that made it possible for us to do so? It's because we weren't starting from a standing start. We had been iterating on and remaking our fulfillment capabilities for nearly two decades. In every business we pursue, we're constantly experimenting and inventing. We're divinely discontented with customer experiences, whether they're our own or not. We believe these customer experiences can always be better, and we strive to make customers' lives better and easier every day. The beauty of this mission is that you never run out of runway; customers always want better, and our job is both to listen to their feedback and to imagine what else is possible and invent on their behalf. People often assume that the game-changing inventions they admire just pop out of somebody's head, a light bulb goes off, a team executes to that idea, and presto-you have a new invention that's a breakaway success for a long time. That's rarely, if ever, how it happens. One of the lesser known facts about innovative companies like Amazon is that they are relentlessly debating, re-defining, tinkering, iterating, and experimenting to take the seed of a big idea and make it into something that resonates with customers and meaningfully changes their customer experience over a long period of time. Let me give you some Amazon examples. **Our Fulfillment Network:** Going back to the pandemic, there's no way we could have started working on our fulfillment network in March 2020 and satisfied anything close to what our customers needed. We'd been innovating in our fulfillment network for 20 years, constantly trying to shorten the time to get items to customers. In the early 2000s, it took us an average of 18 hours to get an item through our fulfillment centers and on the right truck for shipment. Now, it takes us two. To deliver as reliably and cost-effectively as we desire, and to serve Amazon Prime members expecting shipments in a couple of days, we spent years building out an expansive set of fulfillment centers, a substantial logistics and transportation capability, and reconfigured how we did virtually everything in our facilities.\",\n",
