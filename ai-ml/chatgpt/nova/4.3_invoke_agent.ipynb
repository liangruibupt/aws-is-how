    "# Agents for Amazon Bedrock - Testing Agent Invocation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides sample code for testing the agent invocation using the [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agent-runtime.html) client for `bedrock-agent-runtime`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "Now that we've created the agent and attached the knowledge base to it, we will use the runtime client to invoke the agent with different queries. The boto3 sdk for agent is divided into two clients: `bedrock-agent` and `bedrock-agent-runtime`. The `bedrock-agent` client is responsible for the functionalities to create, update, delete and/or prepare an agent or a knowledge base. While the `bedrock-agent-runtime` is responsible for invoke an agent (with the [`invoke_agent`](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agent-runtime/client/invoke_agent.html) API) and retrieve documents from a knowledge base (with the [`retrieve`](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agent-runtime/client/retrieve.html) and [`retrieve_and_generate`](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/bedrock-agent-runtime/client/retrieve_and_generate.html) APIs). This notebook will focus on the runtime invocation of the agent created in the previous notebooks. We will use the `invoke_agent` API.\n",

    "- Invoke agent with prompt attributes\n",
    "- Invoke agent with trace enabled\n",
    "- Invoke agent with different languages for the request\n",

    "#### Create support invokeAgent function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's again use the same support function called `invoke_agent_helper` from `agents.py` to allow us to invoke the agent with or without trace enabled and with or without session state. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function allows the user to send a `query` to the agent with a `session_id`. The user can then decide to enable trace or not using the `enable_trace` boolean variable and to pass a session state as a dictionary via the `session_state` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a new `session_id` is provided, the agent will create a new conversation without previous context. If the same `session_id` is reused, the conversation history related to that session id is made available to the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `enable_trace` is set to `True`, each response from the agent is accompanied by a *trace* that details the step being orchestrated by the agent. It allows you to follow the agent's (reasoning via Chain of Thoughts prompting) that led to the final response at that point of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can also pass a session context using the `session_state` parameter. The session state allows you to share the following information with the agent:\n",
    "- **`sessionAttributes`**: attributes that persist over a session between the user and the agent. All invokeAgent calls with the same session_id belong to the same sesison and will have the sessionAttributes shared with them as long as the session time limit has not being surpassed and the user has not ended the session. The sessionAttributes are available in the lambda function but are **not** added to the agent's prompt. As a result, you can only use session attributes if your lambda function can handle them. You can find more examples of using a session attribute [here](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/agents-for-bedrock/features-examples/06-prompt-and-session-attributes). It is also a good pattern to implement fine-grained access control for certain APIs using the lambda function integration. You can find an example for it [here](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/agents-for-bedrock/features-examples/09-fine-grained-access-permissions)\n",
    "- **`promptSessionAttributes`**: attributes that persist over a single invokeAgent call. Prompt attributes are added to the prompt and to the lambda function. You can also use the `$prompt_session_attributes$` placeholder when editing the orchestration base prompt.\n",
    "- **`invocationId`**: The id returned by the agent in the [ReturnControlPayload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_ReturnControlPayload.html) object in the returnControl field of the InvokeAgent response. This field is required if passing the answer of a Return of Control invocation. You can find an example of how to use it [here](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/agents-for-bedrock/features-examples/03-create-agent-with-return-of-control).\n",
    "- **`returnControlInvocationResults`**: the results obtained from invoking the action outside of agents for Amazon Bedrock.  This field is required if passing the answer of a Return of Control invocation. You can find an example of how to use it [here](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/agents-for-bedrock/features-examples/03-create-agent-with-return-of-control)."

The Group's legendary levels of service underpinned an increase in rates, and it continued to build occupancy, which translated into substantial improvements in Revenue Per Available Room ('RevPAR') across almost all hotels. Hotels in Asia benefitted from the return of travel demand from Chinese mainland following the removal of restrictions at the beginning of 2023, generating substantially higher management fees. Two of the Group's key owned hotels in the region \\u2013 Hong Kong and Tokyo \\u2013 delivered notably better performance than in 2022. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa ('EMEA'), hotels reported solid growth over 2022 and gained market share, particularly in resort destinations. In America, RevPAR performance remained broadly stable, with easing domestic leisure demand partially offset by higher demand from corporate and group travellers. # Sustainability We believe the long-term success of our business hinges on doing the right things for our planet and our people.\",\n",

Non-trading losses of US$446 million primarily comprised a non-cash revaluation of the Causeway Bay site under development, resulting in a loss attributable to shareholders of US$365 million. Net debt fell to US$225 million at the end of 2023, from US$376 million at the end of 2022, reflecting significantly higher operating cashflow from the business, net of ongoing capital investment, as well as proceeds from disposals. Gearing as a percentage of adjusted shareholders' funds was 5%, compared to 8% at the end of 2022. The Directors recommend a final dividend of US\\u00a23.50 per share.\",\n",

The Group grew its Management Business, with two new openings and the announcement of eight new hotel and residences projects. Our colleagues continued to provide the exceptional service for which the brand is legendary and secured record room rates, which translated into strong operating and financial performance. # 2023 Financial performance Underlying profit increased to US$81 million, from US$8 million in 2022, with underlying earnings per share at US\\u00a26.41, compared with US\\u00a20.60 in 2022. Non-trading losses of US$446 million primarily comprised a non-cash revaluation of the Causeway Bay site under development, resulting in a loss attributable to shareholders of US$365 million. Net debt fell to US$225 million at the end of 2023, from US$376 million at the end of 2022, reflecting significantly higher operating cashflow from the business, net of ongoing capital investment, as well as proceeds from disposals. Gearing as a percentage of adjusted shareholders' funds was 5%, compared to 8% at the end of 2022. The Directors recommend a final dividend of US\\u00a23.50 per share.    </text>    <sources>        <source>1</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        The Directors recommend a final dividend of US\\u00a23.50 per share. This, together with the interim dividend of US\\u00a21.50 per share declared, will result in total dividends of US\\u00a25.00 per share. # Year in review In 2023, ABC Grand , with its distinctive portfolio of hotels, was able to satisfy consumers' continuing robust appetite for luxury leisure travel. The Group's legendary levels of service underpinned an increase in rates, and it continued to build occupancy, which translated into substantial improvements in Revenue Per Available Room ('RevPAR') across almost all hotels. Hotels in Asia benefitted from the return of travel demand from Chinese mainland following the removal of restrictions at the beginning of 2023, generating substantially higher management fees. Two of the Group's key owned hotels in the region \\\\u2013 Hong Kong and Tokyo \\\\u2013 delivered notably better performance than in 2022. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa ('EMEA'), hotels reported solid growth over 2022 and gained market share, particularly in resort destinations. In America, RevPAR performance remained broadly stable, with easing domestic leisure demand partially offset by higher demand from corporate and group travellers. # Sustainability We believe the long-term success of our business hinges on doing the right things for our planet and our people.    </text>    <sources>        <source>2</source>    </sources></answer_part><answer_part>    <text>        Before you arrive.
